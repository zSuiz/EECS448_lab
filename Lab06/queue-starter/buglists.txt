List of bugs during testing

Enqueue is causing the problem in the program. It is the bug.
By using Test7, Test8, Test11. I can tell that enqueue is not adding to the back of queue list. Instead, it adds new elements to the top (very similar to stack pushes elements)
For example Test 11

test11->enqueue(5);
test11->enqueue(4);
test11->enqueue(100);
test11->enqueue(10);
test11->enqueue(1);
normal queue list should be after enqueue (FIFO): Front of queue [5,4,100,10,1] Back of queue
but bug enqueue causes: Front of queue [1,10,100,4,5] Back of queue

And because of that bug, dequeue and peekFront also give the wrong results.

  dequeue does dequeue from the front of the error enqueue list.
  test11->dequeue();
  this will dequeue 1  of the list:  Front of queue [1,10,100,4,5] Back of queue   RESULT =>  Front of queue [10,100,4,5] Back of queue



  peekFront also peek top of error enqueue list
  test11->peekFront();
  this will peekFront 1 of the queue list:  Front of queue [1,10,100,4,5] Back of queue
